# Vue Hotel Management

A personal Vue.js side project that I used v-model to do the two-way data binding and apply it to filter, keyword search...etc. This is a simple hotel management page. It allows the user to edit the room's price and status on the backstage and shows on the frontstage (preview) directly. It also provides the price filter and keyword search features.
